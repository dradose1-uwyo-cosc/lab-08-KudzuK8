## Worked with/sources 
* Emmanuel gave a hint about the check_string function. I was going to 
*write it in a similar way to begin with, but I didn't realize you could do
*two variables this way with one except. His way broke when I put an float in, I suspect
*because the first var breaks so it moves on to except instead of trying again. So I made it two 
*try statements, then it kept turning the ints to floats, so I added a if "." is present statement
*to solve that. I didn't think of making the value itself False, which was an interesting concept.
*that didn't work in the second function because there are several vars.
* Google search "how to use return variable in python" gave me the idea to call the function
* in a variable (this was very exciting because I have been struggling with how in the heck you use
* return. This would have been very helpful for the last homework.). I also had to ask Daniel Radosevich
* how to unsquare a number for the square root. Google search "how to turn a number negative," which said
* times it by negative one (duh, my brain is slow today)
